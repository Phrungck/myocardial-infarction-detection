## Detection of Myocardial Infarction Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques
This work is just a two-week exercise to kick-off my research in 2D echocardiography. This repository contains the scripts for Harris Corner Detector, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), LSTM, image enhancements, and many more. Also wrote a paper describing my work: https://github.com/Phrungck/myocardial-infarction-detection/blob/main/Paper.pdf

## Image Manipulations
* Gaussian Blur
* Gray-level slicing
* Otsu Thresholding
